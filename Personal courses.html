<h1>My Courses</h1>

<p>As of current, the only course I am taking is CIS-1420, titled "HTML5 Programming", an online class taught by Professor Nasser.</p>

<p>However, a similar online class that I had taken a semester prior, was focused on the basics of Networking topologies. This was titled CIS-1300 "Networking Concepts", and was taught by Professor McAllister.</p>

<p>Below is a respective table of assigned projects that I have worked on from these classes:</p>
