<h1>Hello!</h1>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>

<p>My name's Umar Khan.<br>I am a 23 year old student that is currently enrolled in Oakland Community College.<br>My lifelong interest in computers has lead me to pursue an Associate's Degree in Computer Science.</p>

<h2>Some of my Favorite Things</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Anime, mainly Dragon Ball Z. Goku is my GOAT for life^^! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goku">He has a Wikipedia article that sums his character up pretty well while being a short & convenient read at the same time.</a></li>
	<li>A great TV Show I love is King of the Hill. It's laid back, realistic, and extremely funny at the same time, especially the first few seasons, which are widely considered the best.</li>
	<li>If you're looking for a great realistic series to get into that has mature themes, Breaking Bad, followed by Better Call Saul has an intense and abundant action-filled timeline and storylines to explore.</li>
</ul>
